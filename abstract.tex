In this article a flexible Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) system for data
logging and presentation will be described. The system is highly modular and
adaptable and can be used in any laboratory where continuous storage and/or ad
hoc measurement wishes to be stored centralized. A presentation backend for the
data backend has furthermore been written which enables live visualization of
data on any device capable of displaying html webpages.

The system consists of three main parts: data logging clients, a data server
and a data presentation website. The logging of data from independent clients
leads to high resilience to equipment failure while the central storage of
data dramatically ease backup and data exchange. The visualization frontend
allows direct monitoring of acquired data to see live progress of experiments
performed on long time scales. This enables the user to alter experimental
conditions based on these data and to interfere with the experiment if needed.
The data stored consist both of specific measurements and of continuously
logged system parameters. The latter is crucial to a variety of automation and
surveillance features and three cases of such features are described:
monitoring system health, getting the status of the equipment during
experiments with long duration and the implementation of instant alarms in the
event of failure.
