In this article the creation of a flexible Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) system for data logging and presentation will be
described. The flexibility of the system originates from the use
primarily of FOSS and from the structure of the system. This structure
consists of three parts, a data server, data logging clients and a
data presentation website. The logging of data from independent
clients leads to high resilience to equipment failure, while the
central storage of data dramatically ease backup and data
exchange. The data stored consist both of specific measurements and of
continuously logged system parameters. The latter is crucial to a
variety of automation and surveillance features and 3 cases of such
features are described; monitoring system health, getting the status of
the equipment during experiments with long durations and implementing
instant alarms in the event of cooling water failure.
