The system consists of three logically separate components as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview}; 1) the equipment component where all
communication with apparatus and acquisition of data is performed 2) the
servers which consist of the MySQL server that stores the acquired data from
experiments and the webserver which interacts and presents the user with data
retrieved from the database and 3) the user component which is made up of the
clints whishing to access the data. \begin{figure}

The system is highly modular meaning the servers can accept data from a range
of different sources. In the current setup equipment interfaced with RS232,
GPIB, USB, analog/digital data acquisition cards standards are logged to the
MySQL database. The user can furthermore use programs written in a wide variety
of languages. As a testimony to this software written in both LabView and
Python are used to save data to the database. How the integration with the
server and subsequent storage of data in the database is performed is hence a
user determined design decision. This has a number of attractive advantages.
The user(s) can integrate existing software with the databases quickly and
without the need to rewrite any previous interface software written for
experimental setups. Furthermore, due to the flexibility of system, if online
storage in the database during acquisition is not possible due to software
limitations the data can still be saved in the database by subsequent offline
parsing of the data files. This, however, still requires that the file format,
which holds the data, is specified or the data can be exported to a flat text
format from the acquisition software. As an additional advantage of a
centralized database containing all experimental data backup is simplified.
Backup of experimental data on the local client is hence, from a user's point
of view, transparent as this can be performed by routine jobs on the server.

The servers consist of a MySQL server and a webserver. All experimental data is
stored on the MySQL server while most of the data is presented to the user from
the webserver. If needed, experimental data from the MySQL server can be
directly retrieved for later analysis. Furthermore, by logging experimental
data from clients continuously, alarm triggers can be used to warn users when
logged parameters fall out of range. The webserver runs a backed of Python/PHP
which is used to display the data to users via a website. Data is hence fetched
from the MySQL server by the webserver and subsequently presented for the user.
To accommodate a range of users and provide the largest flexibility the
webserver displays both a standard HTML/CSS site for desktop PCs and a mobile
version suitable for tablet/smartphone users.

Access for users is provided in primarily two different ways. Either the user
can use a computer or a handheld device to access the data. The webinterface,
with which the user interacts, is also capable of routine data treatment. This
can either be range change of displayed data, plotting on a log scale,
performing a running average, etc. In this way the user can easily and quickly
get an overview of acquired data.
