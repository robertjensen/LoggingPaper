The system is based on Python, PHP and HTML/CSS integrated with Linux
servers running MySQL and Apache (LAMP setup). Experimental data is
acquired on the user side and subsequently stored in the MySQL
database. Python, PHP and HTML/CSS is used to extract data from the
database and present them to the end user in a simple interactive
webinterface for data visualization and manipulation. Python was
primarily chosen due to its tight integration with scientific
packages, such as SciPy and NumPy, which makes data analysis and
treatment more convenient\cite{Cahn2007}. PHP and HTML/CSS is used to
display data in standardized formats suitable for web browsers and
process input from the user. The combination of PHP and HTML/CSS to
process user input from webpages is very flexible and has proven
successful in other parts of the scientific community\cite{Crane2008}.

The system consists of three logically separate components as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview}; 1) the equipment component where all
communication with equipment and acquisition of data is performed 2) the
servers which consist of the MySQL server that stores the acquired data from
experiments and the Apache webserver which interacts and presents the user with data
retrieved from the database and 3) the user component which is made up of the
clints whishing to access the data. \begin{figure}

The system is highly flexible meaning the servers can accept data from
a range of different sources. In the current setup equipment
interfaced with RS232, GPIB, USB and analog/digital data acquisition
cards standards are logged to the MySQL database. The user can
furthermore use programs written in a wide variety of languages. As a
testimony to this, software written in both LabView and Python are
used to save data to the database. How the integration with the server
and subsequent storage of data in the database is performed is hence a
user determined design decision. This has a number of advantages.  The
user(s) can integrate existing software with the databases quickly and
without the need to rewrite any previous interface software written
for experimental setups. Furthermore, due to the flexibility of
the system, if storage in the database during acquisition is not
possible due to software limitations the data can still be saved in
the database by subsequent post experiment parsing of data files. This,
however, still requires that the file format, which holds the data, is
specified or the data can be exported to a flat text format from the
acquisition software.

The servers consist of a MySQL server and a webserver. All experimental data is
stored on the MySQL server and is presented to the user from the webserver. If
needed, experimental data from the MySQL server can be retrieved directly for
later analysis. The webserver runs a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
PHP/Python) package which is used to display the data to users via
a website. Data is hence fetched from the MySQL server by the webserver and
subsequently presented for the user. To accommodate a range of users and
provide the largest flexibility the webserver displays both a standard HTML/CSS
site for desktop PCs and a mobile version suitable for tablet/smartphone users.

The webinterface, which takes user input and displays data to the
user, is also capable of routine data treatment. This can either be
zoom of data, plotting on a log scale, performing a running average,
etc. The data treatment is easily extendable allowing the user to add
any function necessary. In this way the user can easily and quickly
get an overview of acquired data.
