  abstract = {Many industries, both within and outside healthcare, have benefited
	from the adoption of open-source software and open standards. Notable
	examples of this include the use of open-source languages, such as
	Python and Perl to perform both chemo- and bioinformatics work. In
	parallel industries, most of the world's largest Web sites operate
	on open-source software both in the operating system (Linux) and
	the Web server software (Apache).However, the field of laboratory
	automation has neither adopted nor created a great deal of standards
	and has also not taken advantage of the wide range of open-source
	software available. This article introduces open-source software
	and discusses the benefits to a wider world and the possible advantages
	to the field of drug discovery and laboratory automation.},

  abstract = {Within the past few years a new paradigm for software organization
	and intercommunication has emergedâSOA, or Service-Oriented Architecture.
	This article explores the relevance of this approach to automation
	and control of laboratory devices and examines some of the excellent
	open-source software tools, libraries, and frameworks available to
	implement software according to SOA principles. Not only can the
	open-source packages described here serve as the basis for practical
	laboratory automation systems, they also can serve an educational
	role to illustrate the principles and advantages of an SOA approach.
	Open-source software represents a significant opportunity for leveraging
	the skills and budgets of small automation development groups to
	produce very sophisticated and reliable software systems that would
	otherwise be out of reach for such small teams. An added benefit
	is that because of the standardized protocols involved, opportunities
	for interoperation with other systems that are following a similar
	approach becomes a realistic possibility. Although intellectual property
	and licensing issues may represent a barrier to the open-source approach
	for commercial developers seeking to market their solutions, it may
	be the ideal approach for many in-house projects and for standardized
	elements within commercial packages.},

  abstract = {Traditional lab automation systems are highly centralized: dispatch
	and coordination of activities are mediated by a system controller,
	usually via a single, monolithic control procedure. This approach,
	while conceptually simple, makes changes to the system difficult;
	adding or removing instruments and functionality can be a daunting
	task. In addition, most automated systems are tied to particular
	development languages and protocols, making operation in heterogeneous
	environments (i.e., the real world) problematic, since instrument
	software comes in many different implementations.We present a peer-to-peer
	architecture for lab automation, using an XML-based communication
	protocol. The architecture consists of peer instrument servers, an
	XML communication layer, and an open control center. Each instrument
	peer can control, be controlled by, and communicate information to
	other instrument peers to fulfill the automation task. Our protocol
	is based on XML-RPC, a lightweight communication standard built atop
	HTTP. This provides an open and flexible means of peer-to-peer interfacing.
	The control center serves as a convenient, Web-based interface to
	manage the instruments. The automated procedure can be distributed
	across all available instrument peers (each instrument assigned a
	set of responsibilities); the controller implements a limited set
	of high-level instructions. The software components included in our
	prototype system are implemented in various programming languages,
	including Java, C/C++, Visual Basic, and LabVIEW. Our approach facilitates
	rapid development of laboratory automation systems.},

	With the real-time kernel, the system is capable of deterministic

	This facility provides an environment for remote users to learnmany

	The laboratory architecture that makes up the remote automation laboratory
	(RAL) is based on a Moodle-server master PC (MPC), which also manages
	the booking system of PLC benches available in the laboratory. There
	exist a cluster of virtual machines (VMs) running on several slave
	PCs (SPCs), four VMs per SPC. Each VM can manage a type of PLC bench
	of the automation laboratory. The MPC server balances the load of
	SPCs allowing the implementation and easy upgrading of the RAL offering
	different PLCs at the same time within the same remote interface.
	The remote laboratory has Internet protocol cameras providing a view
	of the real environment of each PLC bench to the remote user. The
	authentication system and management of remote users and PLC benches
	are made via Moodle plug-ins and hypertext preprocessor (PHP) scripts.
	Two external/internal routers dynamically configure the remote users'
	access to a particular PLC bench. RAL architecture can be applied
