Our system-design of many highly decentralized clients all pushing data
continuously to a central server means, that this server must both high
perfomance, high uptimes as well as the a flexible storage to ensure that it is
always possible to add more space if so needed. To ensure these properties of
the system, we have deliberately chosen a system as simple as possible to avoid
unneccessary complications, and to ensure that this central component can be
easily managed by the professional IT-staff of the derpartement. It is
important to realized that even though it typically is not a problem if a
single client machine somewhare in the system is temporarily down (this can
happen for many reasons in a experimental lab), it is crucial that this
particular server is handled by professionally.
