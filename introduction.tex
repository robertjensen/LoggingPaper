In every experimental laboratory the need for acquisition and subsequent
logging of data is essential. The acquired data from a given
experiment is typically stored locally on a laboratory computer and is often
acquired in highly specialized proprietary software tightly integrated with the
experimental equipment by the manufacturer. These software suites often saves
to closed proprietary formats which are difficult to exchange across several
computers (e.g. a laboratory computer and a office computer) as specialized
software both to read and export the data files is required. The software
furthermore typically also requires additional licenses increasing complexity
and cost. The exchange of acquired data between different computers with
different operating systems, setup etc. is hence cumbersome and difficult due
to the nature of closed proprietary formats.

To avoid difficult data exchange and simplify data processing

an open source software platform is a much more
attractive solution\cite{Benn2009,Murray2011,So2007}. To accommodate these
demands we have written an open source platform for saving, logging, treating
and visualizing experimental data.

In the present work we describe a totally open source system consisting of data
acquisition, storage in a centralized database and a comprehensive display
module including simple data treatment algorithms licensed as open source
software.
