In every experimental laboratory the need for acquisition and subsequent
logging of data is of essential importance. Typically, logbooks, either in
electronic or paper form, is used to organize large amounts of data and note
down experimental parameters. The acquired data from a given experiment is
typically stored locally on the laboratory computer. The data is often acquired
in highly specialized proprietary software in proprietary formats. When working
with different experimental systems across several computers with different
software suites, operating systems etc. the exchange of acquired data is
cumbersome and difficult due to the nature of proprietary formats.

A solution to simplify and make data exchange easier across several platforms
is to store all acquired experimental data on a centralized server. This has a
number of attractive features. Firstly, by storing data on a centralized server
backup of all experimental data enormously simplified. Secondly, the data is
stored in a standardized and open format which allows easy export of the data
to any platform or software source.

The access to a centralized point of storage for experimental data also allows
for real-time continuous logging of various parameters used as indicators for
system health. Critical system parameters can hence be monitored and used to
trigger alarms when these fall out of specified ranges. Furthermore, the
logging of experimental setup parameters continuously enables access to these
values at any previous point in time.

A centralized storage of data can be accomplished in many ways. However, in
experimental laboratories where large amounts of data are recorded a database
is an obvious choice for storage. Here we present a totally open source system
consisting of data acquisition, storage in a MySQL database and a comprehensive
display module including simple data treatment algorithms which is open source
software.
