In every experimental laboratory the need for acquisition and subsequent
logging of data is of essential importance. The acquired data from a given
experiment is typically stored locally on a laboratory computer and is often
acquired in highly specialized proprietary software which saves to closed
proprietary formats integrated with the hardware by the manufacturer. Closed
proprietary formats are difficult to exchange across several computers (e.g. a
laboratory computer and a office computer) as appropriate software is required
which typically also requires additional licenses increasing complexity and
cost. The exchange of acquired data between different computers with different
operating systems, setup etc. is hence cumbersome and difficult due to the
nature of closed proprietary formats.

To avoid difficult data exchange, simplify data processing and integrate with
experimental equipment an open source software platform is a much more
attractive solution\cite{Benn2009,Murray2011,So2007}. To accommodate these
demands we have written an open source platform for saving, logging, treating
and visualizing experimental data. 

In the present work we describe a totally
open source system consisting of data acquisition, storage in a MySQL database
and a comprehensive display module including simple data treatment algorithms
licensed as open source software.
